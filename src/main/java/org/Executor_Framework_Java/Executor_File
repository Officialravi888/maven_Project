EXECUTOR FRAMEWORK JAVA
NOT-Java.util.concurrent.Executors
class provide a SET of method for creating the thread pools

Executer Framework and create thread pool.

Type of Executers
1).Single Thread Executor
2).Fixed Thread Pool(n)
3).Cached Thread Pool
4).Scheduled Executor

1).Single Thread Executor
Single Thread Executor is a special type of executor that has only a single thread. It is used when we need to executed task in sequential order.
In case when thread dies some error exception at a time
Of executing a task a new thread is created and all the all the subsequent tasks execute in that new one.
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();

2).Fixed Thread Pool(n)
FixedThreadPool is another special type of executor that is thread pool having a fixed number of threads.
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);
3).Cached Thread Pool
CachedThreadPool is a special type of thread pool that is used to execute short-lived parallel tasks
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();

4).Scheduled Executor
It is also used when we need to delay a certain task
ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecService = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1);

scheduleAtFixedRate and scheduleWithFixedDelay
1).ScheduledExecutor
2).scheduleAtFixedRate

scheduledExecService.scheduleAtFixedRate(Runnable command, long initialDelay, long period, Timeunit unit)
scheduledExecService.scheduleWithFixedRate(Runnable command, long initialDelay, long period, Timeunit unit)
