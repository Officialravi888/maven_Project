Exception is an unwanted or unexpected event, which occurs during the execution of a program, i.e.
 at run time, that disrupts the normal flow of the program’s instructions. In Java,
 there are two types of exceptions:

Checked exceptions
Unchecked exceptions

The program doesn’t compile, because the function main() uses FileReader() and FileReader() throws
a checked exception FileNotFoundException. It also uses readLine() and close() methods,
and these methods also throw checked exception IOException
